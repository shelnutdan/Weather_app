# Weather App

This project is a Weather app where the user can enter in a zip-code or city and country. The weather will only allow for an either or entry for these fields upon submission. The user can decide between either a forecast for the current date or for the next five days, include the current date. Then the user can choose between Fahrenheit or Celsius as their unit of measure for their weather forecast, the user can toggle between unit of measure and the temperature display will change upon the change. Once the user clicks the submit button, the Weather will give one of the following responses:
- Forecast with  weather conditions, temperature, and date.
- A single or five day forecast depending on the user's decision
- A warning to the user if they entered in both a zip-code and city, country location, left both empty, or an invalid entry for either location.
